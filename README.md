# Dividend-Calcualtor
This c program predtics the market value of your dividend stock portfolio.

Users will be asked to input starting principal, Distribution Frequency,
Annual Dividend Yield, Expected Annual Share Price Appreciation, and Years Invested.

Then this program will prinout the the market valuen of user's dividend stock portfolio after X years,
and what their (Yearly/Quarterly/Monthly) dividend will be.

I uploaded 4 files(Swift, Python, C, C++). All of them do same thing. Currently only python version supports graph. Will update files with other languages gradually.

Below is the screenshot of how this program actually work.
